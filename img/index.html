            Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922
            – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor,
            publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run
            business called Timely Comics which would later become Marvel
            Comics. He was the primary creative leader for two decades, leading
            its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a
            multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film
            industries. In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly
            co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic
            characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man,
            Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black
            Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black
            Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s
            pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and in
            the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code
            Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the
            1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other
            media, with mixed results. Stanley Martin Lieber was born on
            December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New York City,[3] in the apartment
            of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (née Solomon)
            and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End
            Avenue.[4][5] Lee was raised in a Jewish household. In a 2002
            interview, he stated when asked if he believed in God, "Well, let me
            put it this way... [Pauses.] No, I'm not going to try to be clever.
            I really don't know. I just don't know."[6] On another interview
            from 2011, when asked about his Romanian origins and his
            relationship with the country, he said that he had never visited it
            and that he did not know Romanian because his parents never taught
            it to him.[7] Lee's father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only
            sporadically after the Great Depression.[4] The family moved further
            uptown to Fort Washington Avenue,[8] in Washington Heights,
            Manhattan. Lee had one younger brother named Larry Lieber.[9] He
            said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by books and movies,
            particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles.[10]
            Reading The Scarlet Pimpernel, he called the title character "the
            first superhero I had read about, the first character who could be
            called a superhero."[11] By the time Lee was in his teens, the
            family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The
            Bronx. Lee described it as "a third-floor apartment facing out
            back". Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents
            slept on a foldout couch.[9] Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School
            in the Bronx.[12] In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing, and entertained
            dreams of writing the "Great American Novel" one day.[13] He said
            that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing
            obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National
            Tuberculosis Center;[14] delivering sandwiches for the Jack May
            pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy
            for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on
            Broadway;[15] and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald
            Tribune newspaper.[16] At fifteen, Lee entered a high school essay
            competition sponsored by the New York Herald Tribune, called "The
            Biggest News of the Week Contest." Lee claimed to have won the prize
            for three straight weeks, goading the newspaper to write him and ask
            him to let someone else win. The paper suggested he look into
            writing professionally, which Lee claimed "probably changed my
            life."[17] He graduated from high school early, aged sixteen and a
            half,[why?][how?] in 1939 and joined the WPA Federal Theatre
            Project.[18]
